FlappySound
===============

A Flappy Bird Clone made using [python-pygame][1] playable with your voice using arduino and sound sensor
It's a fork from an existing project: `git clone https://github.com/sourabhv/FlappyBirdClone.git` or click `Download ZIP` in right panel and extract it.
The code was great and well documented, really big thanks to https://github.com/sourabhv
I modified some element of the game to make it easier to play with voice

------

1. Install Python 2.7.X or 3.5.x from [here](https://www.python.org/download/releases/)

4. Edit `flappy.py` and change the variable `Port` by the port used by your arduino
